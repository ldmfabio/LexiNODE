Para isso, foi necessário, primeiramente, estabelecer o que é gamificação, estudar e compreender o ambiente acadêmico, por meio de um questionário aplicado aos seus atores, e determinar de que maneira a gamificação beneficiaria o processo atual para, que então, se iniciasse o desenvolvimento da aplicação de auxilio à tomada de decisão. Os resultados obtidos sugerem que o sistema foi capaz de formalizar o processo e auxiliar a seleção de novos alunos, além de motivar o aprendizado.",

For the analysis, the concept of categories and dimensions of information quality, proposed by Wang will be used. The result presented by the research indicates that, for users, information quality is relatively good, but needs attention to some dimensions for success and greater assertiveness in decision-making.",

However, for this system to be applied effectively in the organization, it is necessary to analyze the level of acceptance of this technology by all sectors of the organization. From these assumptions, this article aims to analyze the level of acceptance of ERP, implemented for more than four years in a company of thermoplastic injection, located in Brazil. For this analysis, the TAM model (Acceptance Technology Model) was used to aid in the identification of issues related to acceptance and use of the ERP. To collect data, a questionnaire containing 29 questions was applied daily in the organization for a group of 30 employees using the ERP. It was possible to identify the Perceived Ease of Use Perceived Usefulness interfered in the ERP, affecting the Real Use of System.",

In order to help organizations get value from IST several management models have emerged. IT-CMF is a comprehensive reference to guide the evolution in 36 different areas of the organization, in terms of its relationship with IST. The adoption of IT-CMF requires managers to decide on the areas to be enhanced, in order to make better use of organizational resources to add value to the organization's business, and to find the best path for improvement of IST. To assist managers in this process, this study presents a network analysis of IT-CMF, by the use of graphs as a means to clarify development paths, which include areas to prioritize for the use of resources, and that are aligned with the objectives of the organization.",

The sustainable extraction of value from IST requires organizations to make efforts to maintain the use of IST aligned with the organization’s objectives. IT-CMF consists of a comprehensive framework to guide the evolution of an organization’s exploitation of IST in 36 management areas. Based on this framework, several evolutionary paths for the improvement of the IST capability can be derived. The prioritization and selection among the available paths may pose a problem for organizations, especially due to the intricate relationships betwee the different areas of intervention. In this study, we resort to Graph Theory to conduct a network analysis of IT-CMF, in order to assist organizations choosing the evolutionary path with the greatest potential for improving their use of IST, taking into account their strengths, weaknesses, and priorities.",

The definitions for these concepts are not consensual and the instantiations of the concepts are written in non-standard ways.

This work carries out an analysis of several competency frameworks and proposes the application of grammatical classes for the concepts that make up the competency structure, aiming at greater transparency and clarity in the use of the concepts. To this end, a Backus-Naur Form grammar is proposed to standardize the writing of concepts. Seeking to validate the competency grammar, Information Systems and Technology professionals reported attributes of their occupations, observing the proposed grammatical rules. Afterwards, the exercise was replicated with practitioners from four other professional areas.",

This situation causes difficulties when applying competence frameworks for describing the content of jobs and planning the evolution of competences, both at an individual and organizational level. This work focuses on the competence construct, reviewing related concepts and identifying relationships between them. The authors provide a structure for the competence construct, which integrates and articulates the concepts of knowledge, skill, ability, capacity, posture, disposition and behaviour. The structure support the proposal of a mechanism for mapping the internal competences of an organization. The mapping may assist the organization to compare its current set of competences with the desired competence blueprint. Underlying this mechanism is the assumption that individuals working in an organizational environment are the source of competences for the organization. The mechanism may also assist an individual to set a course for professional development. To illustrate the application of the mapping mechanism a scenario informed by an Information Systems and Technology framework is used.",
